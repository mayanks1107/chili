            Bhut Jolokia (Ghost Pepper) is a premium, high-heat chilli with a Scoville Heat Unit (SHU) range of 800,000 to 1,000,000+, making it one of the hottest chillies in the world. Native to Northeast India, it is highly valued by global food manufacturers and spice brands for its intense pungency, strong aroma, and rich capsaicin content. Our Bhut Jolokia is supplied in multiple formats—including fresh pods, sun-dried whole chillies, crushed flakes, and finely milled powder—processed to maintain heat stability, colour, and shelf life for commercial use.
